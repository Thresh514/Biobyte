            "o Place plants under different light intensities (low, medium, high) while keeping CO₂ concentration and temperature constant.",

            "4. Effects of Carbon Dioxide Concentration:",
            "o Adjust the CO₂ concentration around the plants (terrestrial) or in the water (aquatic) while maintaining consistent light intensity and temperature.",
            "o Monitor changes in photosynthetic rate by measuring gas exchange as CO₂ is either consumed or released.",
