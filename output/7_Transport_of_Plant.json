Label each part accordingly.",

Draw a circle for the epidermis, then add layers for the cortex and vascular cylinder. Inside the vascular cylinder, draw several x-shaped structures to represent the xylem and phloem. Label each part accordingly.",

Inside the leaf, draw two layers for the upper and lower epidermis. Between the epidermal layers, draw the mesophyll, which consists of palisade and spongy parenchyma. Add vascular bundles in the mesophyll, connecting to the veins. Label each part accordingly."

            "Key Features: The cell walls in the apoplast pathway are composed of lignin and cellulose, which provide structural support and prevent collapse of the cell walls under tension. Lignin is particularly important for its hydrophobic properties, which help in water movement.",
            "Function: Water moves rapidly through the apoplast pathway, facilitated by the cohesive and adhesive properties of water molecules. However, water must eventually cross the plasma membrane to enter the symplast pathway and reach the xylem.",

The endodermal cells are characterized by the presence of a Casparian strip, which is a band of suberin (a waxy substance) in their cell walls.",
            "Function: The Casparian strip is impermeable to water and ions, forcing water and solutes to cross the plasma membrane of endodermal cells to enter the symplast pathway. This selective barrier allows the plant to control the uptake of water and nutrients from the soil."

            "Cohesion: Water molecules are cohesive, meaning they are attracted to each other. This cohesion is due to hydrogen bonding between water molecules. As water evaporates from the leaves during transpiration, it creates tension (negative pressure) in the xylem.",
            "Tension: The tension created by transpiration pull is transmitted through the water column in the xylem, from the leaves to the roots. This tension is maintained by the cohesive forces between water molecules, which allow them to form a continuous column in the xylem.",

            "Capillary Action: The adhesion of water to cellulose, combined with cohesion between water molecules, allows for capillary action, where water is drawn up narrow tubes (such as xylem vessels) against gravity. This helps water move from the roots to the leaves."

            "Proton Pump Activity: Proton pumps actively transport protons (H+) from the cytoplasm of the companion cell into the cell wall or apoplast. This creates a concentration gradient of protons, with a higher concentration outside the cell than inside.",
            "Cotransport with Protons: Cotransporter proteins are embedded in the plasma membrane of companion cells. These cotransporters facilitate the transport of assimilates, such as sucrose, along with protons. The protons move down their concentration gradient back into the companion cell, while the assimilates are transported against their concentration gradient into the sieve tube.",
            "Transfer to Phloem Sieve Tubes: Once inside the companion cell, assimilates move through plasmodesmata (channels connecting companion cells and sieve tubes) into the sieve tubes. The movement of assimilates into the sieve tubes is driven by the high concentration of assimilates in the companion cell.",

            "Pressure Build-Up: As assimilates are loaded into the sieve tubes, the concentration of solutes (primarily sugars) increases, creating a higher solute potential in the sieve tubes compared to the surrounding cells. This leads to the uptake of water by osmosis, increasing the pressure inside the sieve tubes.",
            "Pressure Gradient: The increase in pressure at the source creates a pressure gradient along the phloem pathway, with higher pressure at the source and lower pressure at the sink. This pressure gradient drives the flow of assimilates through the sieve tubes.",
            "Translocation: Assimilates, along with water, flow through the sieve tubes from regions of high pressure (source) to regions of low pressure (sink). This mass flow of assimilates is driven by the pressure gradient and is a relatively rapid process, allowing for efficient transport over long distances.",
            "Unloading at Sink: At the sink, assimilates are actively unloaded from the sieve tubes by companion cells and used for growth, storage, or other metabolic processes. This unloading reduces the pressure in the sieve tubes at the sink.",
