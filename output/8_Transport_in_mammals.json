It allows haemoglobin to bind oxygen in the lungs, where oxygen levels are high, and release it in tissues with lower oxygen levels, where it is needed for cellular respiration. The sigmoidal shape of the curve indicates cooperative binding, ensuring that oxygen is readily available when and where it is needed most. This adaptability is crucial for supporting aerobic metabolism and overall physiological function in humans and other organisms."

When acidity increases or CO2 levels rise, haemoglobin has a lower affinity for oxygen, meaning it releases oxygen more readily. This is important because it allows haemoglobin to unload oxygen more easily in tissues with high levels of CO2 and low pH, where oxygen is needed for cellular respiration. This shift in the oxygen dissociation curve helps ensure that oxygen is delivered to tissues efficiently, matching oxygen delivery with metabolic demand."
