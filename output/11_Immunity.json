When you get a vaccine, these tiny bits of germs stimulate your immune system, which is like your body's defense force, to produce antibodies. These antibodies are like soldiers that can recognize and fight off the specific germ if you are exposed to it later. The vaccine also helps your immune system develop memory cells, which remember how to fight the germ in the future. This way, if you are ever exposed to the real germ, your immune system can quickly recognize and destroy it, protecting you from getting sick.
