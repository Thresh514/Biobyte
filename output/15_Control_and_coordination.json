            "1. Glands and Hormones:",
            "o Glands: Endocrine glands such as the pituitary gland (where ADH is produced), pancreas (where insulin and glucagon are produced), and others like the adrenal glands, thyroid gland, and gonads (ovaries and testes).",
            "o Hormones: Chemical messengers secreted by endocrine glands directly into the bloodstream, which travel to target tissues or organs to exert their effects.",
            "2. Mode of Action:",
            "o Target Cells: Hormones act on specific target cells that have receptors for the hormone, initiating biochemical reactions within those cells.",
            "o Feedback Mechanisms: Hormone secretion is often regulated by feedback mechanisms, where the levels of certain substances (like glucose or water) in the blood trigger the release or inhibition of hormone production.",
            "3. Transport and Regulation:",
            "o Bloodstream: Hormones are transported through the bloodstream to distant target organs or tissues, where they elicit a response.",
            "o Regulation: Hormone levels are tightly regulated to maintain physiological balance (homeostasis) in the body. This regulation involves feedback loops, often negative feedback, to prevent excessive hormone production or activity.",

            "1. Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH):",
            "Produced by: The hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary gland.",
            "Function: ADH regulates water balance by increasing water reabsorption in the kidneys. It reduces urine volume and helps maintain blood osmolarity (concentration of solutes in blood plasma).",
            "2. Glucagon:",
            "Produced by: Alpha cells of the pancreas.",
            "Function: Glucagon is released in response to low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia). It stimulates the liver to break down glycogen into glucose (glycogenolysis) and promotes the synthesis of glucose from amino acids and glycerol (gluconeogenesis), thereby raising blood glucose levels.",
            "3. Insulin:",
            "Produced by: Beta cells of the pancreas.",
            "Function: Insulin is released in response to high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia). It facilitates the uptake of glucose into cells (especially muscle and adipose tissue), promotes glycogen synthesis in the liver and muscles, and inhibits gluconeogenesis. Insulin thereby lowers blood glucose levels.",
            "Importance of Hormonal Regulation",
            "Homeostasis: Hormones like ADH, glucagon, and insulin play critical roles in maintaining stable internal conditions (homeostasis) such as water balance, glucose levels, and metabolic processes.",
