            "Daily Rhythms:",
            "1. Morning (Light Onset):",
            "o Opening: With the onset of daylight, stomata open to allow carbon dioxide to enter the leaf for photosynthesis. This is driven by light signals that trigger the active transport of potassium ions (K⁺) into guard cells, leading to water influx by osmosis, making guard cells turgid and opening the stomata.",
            "2. Midday (Peak Light Intensity):",
            "o Open: Stomata remain open during periods of high light intensity to maximize carbon dioxide uptake for photosynthesis. However, if the temperature and light intensity are very high, stomata may partially close to reduce excessive water loss.",
            "3. Afternoon (Decline in Light Intensity):",
            "o Partial Closing: As the light intensity decreases in the afternoon, stomata may begin to close slightly to reduce water loss as photosynthetic activity diminishes.",
            "4. Evening (Light Decline and Darkness):",
            "o Closing: In the absence of light, stomata close to conserve water. The loss of light triggers the export of potassium ions (K⁺) out of the guard cells, leading to water efflux and making the guard cells flaccid, resulting in stomatal closure."

            "5. Turgor Pressure:",
            "o The influx of water increases the turgor pressure in the guard cells, making them turgid. Due to the differential thickness of their cell walls, the guard cells bow outward, opening the stomatal pore.",

            "1. Loss of Light or Water Stress:",
            "o In the absence of light or under water stress conditions, the proton pumps become inactive, and the transport processes reverse.",
