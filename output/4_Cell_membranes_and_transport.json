The hydrophobic interactions between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids drive the formation of the bilayer, with hydrophilic heads facing outward and inward toward water. Proteins, both integral and peripheral, are embedded or attached to the membrane, performing various functions. Cholesterol helps regulate membrane fluidity. This model emphasizes the dynamic nature of membranes, with molecules constantly moving and interacting."
